Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

I was provided the vast majority of the code, my role was to implement the deep q-learning for the intelligent pirate agent.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

Throughout this course I learned far more about emerging trends and reinforcement learning than I had ever known before. It was a joy to learn and observe the operation of the pirate
agent work through to the treasure. These types of technologies and techniques are why I got into CS to begin with. 

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer Scientists do many different things but it all goes under the umbrella of software development. It matters because computer scientists push the envelope on 
technology and what is possible, as they are at the forefront of human advancement currently.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Approaching a problem as a computer scientist comes down to logic and problem solving. Breaking down an issue into parts and figuring out multiple solutions to every problem.
That is how a computer scientist approaches a problem to me.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Ethical responsibilities to the user comes down to creating transparent software that is honest about what data it takes and how it uses it. 
In terms of the orginization, the responsibility is to always have its best interests in mind and operate not only on what is easy now, but implement code and software
that will be easy to work with for decades to come.
